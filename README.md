## Usage
1. Ensure that AutoHotkey is installed on your system.
2. Copy the script into a new text file and save it with a `.ahk` extension.
3. Double-click the `.ahk` file to run the script.
4. Launch Path of Exile.
5. Press `F6` to exit the script.

## Script Details
- **Loop:** The script continuously checks if the Path of Exile window is open. If it is, it sends a simulated "Enter" keypress to the game window every 350 milliseconds. This can be useful for tabbing out and using your computer for other things (browsing reddit, etc.)
- **Exit Hotkey (`F6`):** Pressing `F6` terminates the script and exits.

## Notes
- Make sure to run the script as an administrator to ensure proper functioning, especially if Path of Exile is running with elevated privileges.
- This script is provided as-is and may require adjustments based on your system configuration and game settings.

## Bug Fixes
- Update pushed that fixes macro pressing "enter" when on any window that is titled "Path of exile". Ex. PoE reddit, poe trade site, filterblade, etc.
- Update pushed that allows the quit key to work.
